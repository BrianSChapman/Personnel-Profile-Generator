# Personnel-Profile-Generator

## Description

Beginning to work with Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development has lead to this newest project - a Personnel Profile Generator. Using classes and subclasses, I've been able to create a terminal-based survey that, when input has been completed, can generate new employee profiles (Name, role, email, and special parameter dependent upon role) onto a dynamically-created HTML file. The different classes were given their own script which underwent a test suite for each using Jest.   

## Installation

This must be utilized through the terminal (You'll see in the video link below). Installation of the HTML file itself will be complete after all questions that are prompted in the terminal have been answered.

## Usage

Please see the link below for usage of the app itself, the HTML page, and the passing tests.
